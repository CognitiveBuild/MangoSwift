Mango is a mobile app demo about the Watson Speech-to-Text, it can provide the real-time transcription and translation, it can record the audio, translate the language you preferred, and store the audio on the mobile device. Later on we'll add Watson Tone Analyzer to analyze the audio you record, it uses linguistic analysis to detect and interpret emotions, social tendencies, and language style cues found in your audio.
